# Purchasing-Intention-Prediction-An-Artificial-Neural-Network-Approach

This project aims to develop and evaluate an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the purchasing intention of online shoppers using the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset. The model will be developed using Keras, a popular artificial neural network library with a TensorFlow backend. The dataset contains a variety of features, including demographic information, product characteristics, and browsing behavior. The model will be trained on the dataset to learn the relationships between the features and the purchasing intention of online shoppers.

The data used in this analysis is the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset available in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains user activities in the e-commerce domain. There are 17 predictor variables and 1 target variable that determine whether a user will go shopping after browsing the website (just result in a sale). Of the 12,330 sessions in the dataset, 84.5% (10,422) are negative samples that did not end with shopping, and the remainder (1908) are positive samples that ended with shopping.The dataset consists of 10 numeric attributes and 8 categorical attributes. The attribute "Sales" can be used as the class name. Data is in CSV format.
